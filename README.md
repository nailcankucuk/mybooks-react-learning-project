# About The Project

This project consists of 2 pages. On the Dashboard page, the books in these categories are displayed in the "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read" shelves. It can be moved to a different shelf or completely removed from the menu that opens by clicking on the arrow sign at the bottom right of the books.

On the search screen, it is possible to search according to the name of the book or the name of the author. Searchable words are specified in the "search_terms.md" file. We can move what we want among the books that appear in the search results to one of the shelves on the dashboard page, again with the help of the menu on the book.
